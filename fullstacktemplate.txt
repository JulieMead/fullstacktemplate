STEP 1

dependencies(middleware) to install and what it does:
*npm init
*npm install express

*npm install dotenv
what does DOTENV do?
it let us hide variables from our main code ie. passwords/codes
hides the secret stuff

*npm install cors
what does CORS do?
bypasses cross origin request blocks in browser
sets cross origin access policy
now we can access things locally

*npm install mongodb
what is MONGODB?
our database - where data is stored
why do we store data in database and not a text file?
lots of reasons:
we don't have unlimited storage locally
when data starts getting big and complicated MongoDB keeps things organized 
I can only fetch things when I need them and I don't have to hold all of that info all the time

*npm install ejs
what does EJS do?
embedded javascript
helps us dynamically generate html on the fly as we pass info through it

*npm install nodemon --save-dev
what does NODEMON do?
makes it so that we don't have to manually restart the server every time we make a change

what does --save-dev do?
so that nodemon isn't 'in production'...it gets saved to devDependencies instead of will all of the normal dependencies. it is only being used for development

STEP 2

Require dependencies in server.js file

how to require express?

const express = require('express')
const app = express()

do same thing for all dependencies
